# Epic 7 Retrospective - Cross-Cutting Infrastructure Fixes

- Date: 2026-02-23
- Epic: 7
- Status Source: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`
- Facilitator: Bob (Scrum Master)
- Project Lead: 飞哥

## 1. Epic Summary and Metrics

- Epic title: Cross-Cutting Infrastructure Fixes
- Story completion: 3/3 marked `done`
- Retrospective status transition target: `epic-7-retrospective: optional -> done`
- Story keys marked done:
  - `7-1-add-thread-safety-to-map-struct`
  - `7-2-unify-camera-intrinsics-from-configuration`
  - `7-3-add-configuration-parameter-validation`

## 2. Team Participants

- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Developer)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Winston (Architect)
- 飞哥 (Project Lead)

## 3. Successes and Strengths

- Scope discipline: Epic 7 remained tightly focused on cross-cutting stability concerns.
- Coverage of critical foundations:
  - Concurrency safety path defined for map access (`AtomicU64`, `Arc<RwLock<Map>>`).
  - Intrinsics consistency moved toward single-source configuration.
  - Config validation requirements explicitly include guardrails and clear error messaging.
- Delivery signal: sprint tracking marks all Epic 7 stories complete.

## 4. Challenges and Growth Areas

- Evidence gap: no Epic 7 story markdown artifacts were found under `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts`.
- Verification gap: completion is currently traceable in sprint status, but implementation notes, review logs, and QA outcomes for Epic 7 are not present in artifact form.
- Process gap: retrospective-quality evidence (lessons, debt, test outcomes per story) cannot be audited from artifacts alone.

## 5. Key Insights and Learnings

- Tracking alone is not enough; story-level evidence is needed for reliable retrospectives.
- Cross-cutting infrastructure work benefits from explicit acceptance evidence (before/after behavior, concurrency tests, config validation failure cases).
- Config unification is high leverage: it reduces drift across VO, BA, loop closing, and fusion modules.

## 6. Previous Retrospective Follow-Through

- Previous epic checked: Epic 6
- Result: no `epic-6-retro-*.md` found in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts`
- Conclusion: no prior retro commitments available for continuity analysis.

## 7. Next Epic Preview and Dependencies

- Next epic number: 8
- Result: no Epic 8 definition found in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`
- Planning implication: roadmap continuation is not yet documented in artifacts.

## 8. Action Items (with Owners and Gates)

1. Restore story evidence completeness for Epic 7.
- Owner: Bob (Scrum Master)
- Gate: before starting the next epic planning cycle
- Success criteria: each Epic 7 story has a corresponding artifact record (implementation notes, review result, QA outcome).

2. Add config-source consistency checks across modules.
- Owner: Winston (Architect)
- Gate: before committing the next epic implementation plan
- Success criteria: a single camera intrinsics source is validated as consumed by VO, BA, loop closing, and 3DGS paths.

3. Add negative-path config validation tests.
- Owner: Dana (QA Engineer)
- Gate: before next release candidate tagging
- Success criteria: invalid config ranges fail fast with clear recovery messages.

## 9. Preparation Tasks for Next Epic

- Create a formal Epic 8 definition in planning artifacts.
- Add a retrospective evidence checklist to story completion criteria.
- Define minimum audit evidence for cross-cutting changes (test proof, review proof, integration proof).

## 10. Critical Path Items

- [ ] Define Epic 8 scope and dependencies in `epics.md`.
- [ ] Backfill Epic 7 story artifacts or link to canonical evidence locations.
- [ ] Confirm intrinsics-source unification with explicit integration verification.

## 11. Significant Discoveries and Recommendations

Significant discovery:
- Artifact mismatch between sprint-level completion and story-level documentary evidence.

Impact:
- Reduces confidence in retrospective depth and may hide unresolved risks.

Recommendation:
- Treat “story marked done” as requiring both status update and evidence payload.

Epic update required:
- Yes, if Epic 8 planning begins before evidence and dependency definition are complete.

## 12. Readiness Assessment

- Testing and quality readiness: Partial confidence (status shows done; detailed QA artifacts missing).
- Deployment/release readiness: Not fully evidenced in implementation artifacts.
- Stakeholder acceptance: Not documented in available artifacts.
- Technical health: Direction is strong; verification artifacts need improvement.
- Unresolved blockers: Epic 8 definition missing.

Overall:
- Epic 7 appears complete from story tracking perspective, but not fully complete from evidence governance perspective.

## 13. Commitments and Next Steps

- Commit to evidence-complete story closure moving forward.
- Commit to defining Epic 8 before new implementation starts.
- Commit to making cross-module config consistency verifiable, not implied.
