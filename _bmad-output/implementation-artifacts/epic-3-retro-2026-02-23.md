- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Developer)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Winston (Architect)

## 3. Successes and Strengths

- Broad functional scope delivered: feature extraction, matching, pose, BA, loop closing, checkpoint/recovery.
- Multiple code-review issues were documented as fixed in planning artifacts.
- Epic 3 completion unblocked downstream stages and enabled Epic 4 execution.

## 4. Challenges and Growth Areas

- Artifact inconsistency detected:
  - `sprint-status.yaml` marks story `3-7` as `done`.
  - `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/3-7-implement-true-binary-brief-descriptors.md` shows `Status: ready-for-dev`.
- Story evidence gap:
  - Only one Epic 3 story file is present in implementation artifacts.
  - Remaining Epic 3 story records are not present in this folder.
- Quality governance risk:
  - Planning artifacts list historical critical findings; without complete story records, validation traceability is weak.

## 5. Key Insights and Learnings

- Completion state must be synchronized across sprint status and story artifacts.
- SLAM quality depends on strict consistency among descriptor format, matcher metric, relocalization behavior, and VO update logic.
- “Fixed in review notes” is not sufficient unless implementation and test evidence are linkable per story.

## 6. Previous Retrospective Follow-Through

- Previous epic checked: Epic 2
- Result: no `epic-2-retro-*.md` found in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts`
- Conclusion: no previous retro commitments available for follow-through analysis.

## 7. Next Epic Preview and Dependencies

- Next epic number: 4
- Epic 4 exists in planning artifacts and is already `in-progress` in sprint status.
- Dependency reality:
  - Epic 4 depends on stable SLAM outputs from Epic 3.
  - Any unresolved Epic 3 quality gaps can directly degrade 3DGS training quality.

## 8. Action Items (with Owners and Gates)

1. Resolve status inconsistency for story 3-7 artifacts.
- Owner: Bob (Scrum Master)
- Gate: before next status audit
- Success criteria: story file status and sprint-status entry are aligned and auditable.

2. Rebuild Epic 3 evidence chain for all stories.
- Owner: Charlie (Senior Developer)
- Gate: before declaring Epic 3 fully governance-complete
- Success criteria: each Epic 3 story has implementation note, review summary, and test evidence reference.

3. Add automated integrity checks for status synchronization.
- Owner: Winston (Architect)
- Gate: before next epic closure workflow
- Success criteria: CI or local tooling flags mismatches between sprint status and story documents.

4. Validate SLAM-to-3DGS contract assumptions used by Epic 4.
- Owner: Dana (QA Engineer)
- Gate: before the next Epic 4 milestone sign-off
- Success criteria: explicit verification of pose stability, descriptor/matcher behavior, and relocalization path quality.

## 9. Preparation Tasks for Epic 4 Continuity

- Create a traceability map from Epic 3 fixes to Epic 4 dependency points.
- Add regression scenarios for known weak spots documented in prior reviews.
- Formalize acceptance gates for cross-epic handoff quality.

## 10. Critical Path Items

- [ ] Synchronize Story 3-7 status artifact with sprint status.
- [ ] Establish missing Epic 3 story evidence references.
- [ ] Run dependency-oriented validation before further Epic 4 commitments.

## 11. Significant Discoveries and Recommendations

Significant discoveries:
- Status mismatch exists for Story 3-7.
- Story-level retrospective evidence is incomplete for Epic 3.

Impact on Epic 4:
- Epic 4 assumptions may rely on incompletely evidenced SLAM quality.

Recommendations:
- Run an Epic 3 evidence reconciliation pass.
- Add a quality gate requiring status-artifact consistency.
- Confirm dependency-critical SLAM behaviors with explicit validation evidence.

Epic update required:
- Yes, if Epic 4 planning or execution assumes proof that is not yet traceable.

## 12. Readiness Assessment

- Testing and quality readiness: Functional progress is strong; traceability is incomplete.
- Deployment/release readiness: Depends on evidence reconciliation outcomes.
- Stakeholder acceptance: Not explicitly documented in available artifacts.
- Technical health: Core capabilities are broad; governance consistency needs reinforcement.
- Unresolved blockers: Story evidence completeness and status synchronization.

Overall:
- Epic 3 is complete by sprint status, but retrospective evidence quality indicates follow-up work is required for high-confidence continuity.

## 13. Commitments and Next Steps

- Commit to artifact-status synchronization as a mandatory closure criterion.
- Commit to evidence-backed cross-epic handoff for Epic 4.
- Commit to making retrospective outputs actionable through enforceable quality gates.
